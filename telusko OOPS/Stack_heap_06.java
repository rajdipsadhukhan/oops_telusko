         * 1. Stack Memory
ðŸ”¹ What is it?
Stack memory stores methods, local variables, and the order of method calls.

It works like a stack of plates â€” last in, first out (LIFO).

ðŸ”¹ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
public void show() {
    int x = 5;  // 'x' is stored in Stack
}
ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
Fast and small.

Automatically managed.

Each thread has its own Stack.

When the method ends, local variables are removed from the stack.

âœ… 2. Heap Memory
ðŸ”¹ What is it?
Heap memory is used to store objects and instance variables (i.e., variables inside a class).

Itâ€™s shared by all threads.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
class Student {
    int age = 20;
}

Student s = new Student();  // 's' is a reference in Stack, object is in Heap
ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
Bigger than Stack.

Slower than Stack.

Managed by Java Garbage Collector (removes unused objects automatically).
