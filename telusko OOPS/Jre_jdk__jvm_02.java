         #23 JDK, JRE, JVM in Java*

- *Introduction & Overview*
  - Java programming involves concepts like classes, variables, methods, and object relations. 
  - Understanding the underlying processes of Java code execution helps relate to new coding concepts. 
  - Compiling Java code requires a tool, specifically the **Java Development Kit (JDK)**.
  - *JDK* is essential for converting Java code into **bytecode**, the format needed for machine execution.

- *JVM (Java Virtual Machine)*
  - The *JVM* is responsible for running the compiled bytecode on a machine.
  - It acts as a virtual layer, ensuring Java remains platform-independent across machines.
  - JVM executes the bytecode, while the computer translates it into a format it can process. 
  - The virtual nature of JVM allows Java code to run consistently across different operating systems.

- *JRE (Java Runtime Environment)*
  - *JRE* provides additional classes and libraries needed to run Java programs, beyond the programmerâ€™s code.
  - It includes tools for validating bytecode and loading classes as needed for execution.
  - JRE encompasses the **JVM**, making it a complete environment for running Java applications.
  - Without JRE, JVM cannot function, as JRE supplies the runtime components.

- *JDK as the Top Layer*
  - As developers, installing *JDK* also installs the JRE and JVM, providing the full toolset for both compiling and running code.
  - On client machines, JRE and JVM might be present alone, sufficient only for running programs.
  - Software may require specific JRE versions, leading to common prompts for JRE or .NET installations/updates.
  - **Conclusion**: JDK contains JRE, which contains JVM, each playing a distinct role in Java execution. Further details about JVM will be explored in the next video.
